# cudawrappers

This library is a C++ wrapper for the Nvidia C libraries (e.g. CUDA driver, nvrtc, cuFFT etc.). The main purposes are:

1. _easier resource management_, leading to _lower risk of programming errors_;
2. _better fault handling_ (through exceptions);
3. _more compact user code_.

Originally, the API enforced RAII to even further reduce the risk of faulty code, but enforcing RAII and compatibility with (unmanaged) objects obtained outside this API are mutually exclusive.

## Requirements

| Software    | Minimum version |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CUDA        | 10.0 or later |
| CMake       | 3.17 or later |
| gcc         | 9.3 or later  |
| OS          | Linux distro (amd64) |

| Hardware    | Type |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| GPU architecture        | [NVIDIA PASCAL](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/geforce/products/10series/architecture/) or newer|

## Usage

We use CMake in this project, so you can clone and build this library with the following steps:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nlesc-recruit/cudawrappers
cd cudawrappers
cmake -S . -B build
make -C build
```

This command will create a `build` folder, compile the code and generate the libraries `libcudawrappers-*.so` in the build directory.
For more details on the building requirements and on testing, check the [developer documentation](README.dev.md).

To install to `~/.local`, use
```shell
git clone https://github.com/nlesc-recruit/cudawrappers
cd cudawrappers
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local -S . -B build
make -C build
make -C build install
```

### Usage examples

You can include the cudawrappers library in your own projects in various ways. We have created a few repositories with example setups to get you started:

1. [usage-example-git-submodules](https://github.com/nlesc-recruit/usage-example-git-submodules) Example project that uses the cudawrappers library as a dependency by using git submodules on its source tree.
1. [usage-example-locally-installed](https://github.com/nlesc-recruit/usage-example-locally-installed) Example project that uses the cudawrappers library as a dependency by having it locally installed.
1. [usage-example-cmake-pull](https://github.com/nlesc-recruit/usage-example-cmake-pull) Example project that uses the cudawrappers library as a dependency by having cmake pull it in from github.
1. there are also examples available in the [examples](examples) directory, they
can be compiled by providing the flag `-DCUDAWRAPPERS_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` to the
cmake command shown above.

## Alternatives

This section provides an overview of similar tools in this space, and how they are different.

### [cuda-api-wrappers](https://github.com/eyalroz/cuda-api-wrappers)

- Aims to provide wrappers for the CUDA runtime API
- Development has slowed a bit recently
- Has 1 or 2 main developers
- Has gained quite a bit of attention (e.g. 440 stars; 57 forks)

The project is planning to support more of the Driver API (for fine-grained control of CUDA devices) and NVRTC API (for runtime compilation of kernels); there is a release candidate ([`v0.5.0-rc1`](https://github.com/eyalroz/cuda-api-wrappers/tree/v0.5.0-rc1)). It doesn't provide support for cuFFT and cuBLAS though.

### [cuda-wrapper](https://github.com/halmd-org/cuda-wrapper)

- Aims to provide a C++ wrapper for the CUDA Driver and Runtime APIs

### [CudaPlusPlus](https://github.com/apardyl/cudaplusplus)

- Aims to provide a C++ wrapper for the CUDA Driver API
- Project appears inactive
